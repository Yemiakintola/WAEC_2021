"""## Data splitting

### Subtask:
Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

**Reasoning**:
Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets using train_test_split, ensuring a stratified split based on the target variable.

**Reasoning**:
The previous attempt to split the data failed due to a class imbalance issue.  The error message indicates that at least one class in the target variable has only one member, which is insufficient for stratified splitting.  I will try to resolve this by dropping the rows with the least populated classes and then retry the splitting process.

**Reasoning**:
The previous attempts to split the data failed due to the removal of all rows. This indicates an issue in the data itself, where many classes have only a single member.  Stratified splitting requires at least two samples per class.  I will try a different approach without stratification.  It will likely result in a less ideal train-validation-test split, but it will avoid the error encountered in previous attempts.

## Summary:

### Q&A
* **What is the best-performing model?**  The Gradient Boosting Regressor, after hyperparameter optimization, showed the best performance.
* **What are the key performance metrics on the test set?**  The best Gradient Boosting model achieved a Test R-squared of 0.9430, a Test RMSE of 2743.3296, and a Test MAE of 1639.8487.
* **Were there any data quality issues?** Yes, inconsistencies were found in the 'TOTAL' column, which was corrected by recalculating it as the sum of 'MALE' and 'FEMALE'.  Additionally, the extremely high R-squared value for the Linear Regression model suggests a potential issue either with data or preprocessing steps.
* **How was the model deployed?** The model was prepared for deployment by saving it as a `.pkl` file and generating a `requirements.txt`.  A Streamlit application was created to load the model and make predictions but could not be run within the environment; it requires local execution.

### Data Analysis Key Findings
* **Data Inconsistencies:** The 'TOTAL' column was found to be inconsistent with the sum of 'MALE' and 'FEMALE' columns in several rows.  This was corrected.
* **Feature Engineering:**  One-hot encoding was applied to the 'STATE' column, and numerical features were scaled and transformed using polynomial features.
* **Model Performance:** The optimized Gradient Boosting model achieved a test R-squared of 0.9430, suggesting a strong fit to the test data.  The Linear Regression model showed suspicious perfect R-squared scores, possibly indicating an issue with the data or preprocessing.
* **Deployment:** The final model was saved as `best\_model.pkl` and a Streamlit app was created for user interaction and prediction.

### Insights or Next Steps
* **Investigate Linear Regression Results:** The perfect R-squared scores for the Linear Regression model are highly unusual.  Further investigation is required to identify the reason for these scores.
* **Expand Hyperparameter Search:** Exploring a wider range of hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting model might lead to further performance improvements.
